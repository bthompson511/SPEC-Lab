# SPEC-Lab
This repository contains some of the scripts I contributed to the Security and Political Economy (SPEC) Lab at University of Southern California in 2021. I assisted in building statistical measures of international economic interdependence for a research project involving complex international economic interdependence. Additionally, I helped with data management for the publicly available International Political Economy Data Resource. For further information about the lab, please visit the SPEC Lab website: https://www.uscspec.org/.

Some notes about the included files:
1. File paths have been ommitted from the script for reasons of privacy and security.
2. You may notice the use of an appendids() function in some of these scripts. This is a SPEC Lab-specific function used to append commonly used international relations country identifier codes to the data set. Its release as a publicly available package is in the works.
